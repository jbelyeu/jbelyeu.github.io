        <h3>Interests and some history</h3>
        <p>I'm still formulating my career direction, since recently increased contact with the research world has shown me so many attractive options. I've had opportunities to work in three different research labs while an undergraduate student at BYU (with Dr. John Prince in Biochemistry, and with Dr. Perry Ridge and Dr. Rick Gill in Biology), which gave me an interest in research. I've also been able to attend the Biotechnology and Bioinformatics Symposium, visit and present at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and visit several graduate schools for interviews.</p>

        <p>These experience helped me develop the interest in genetics and computation that I'll be pursuing at the UNiversity of Utah in the Molecular Biosciences PhD program.</p>


        <h3>Codon Bias</h3> <!-- Link to codon bias abstract as pdf-->
        <p>I worked with Justin Miller, under the supervision of Dr. Ridge, in a project targetted toward understanding evolutionary implications of non-random codon bias. A paper titled <span style="color:#264ec5">"Using Codon Non-Usage In Phylogenies"</span> is under review for publication.</span><!-- Need journal name-->

        <h3>SelecT</h3> <!-- Link to select poster as image-->
        <p>I worked with Hayden Smith, again supervised by Dr. Ridge, on a project to implement and improve the Composite of Multiple Signals study as a Java program. Our work, now managed by Brandon Pickett, is named SelecT (Selection Testing) and we plan submission for publication by the end of this summer. Preliminary results were presented in a poster session at BYU.</p>

        <h3>Seismic Event Detector</h3> <!-- Link to poster as image-->
        <p>In a project for a BYU CS Capstone in Big Data, my team (Artem Golotin, Darian Ramage, and I) developed a scalable system for monitoring seismic signals in a developing aftershock sequence. This could be used to study earthquakes in more detail, as well as to identify illegal nuclear testing events from their aftershock signature. This was presented in person at a special meeting held at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and in a poster session with short talks at BYU.</p>
